                  Since microblading pigments are not implanted into the skin as
                  deep as traditional tattoos, the area will naturally fade
                  overtime. Microblading typically lasts 1-2 years, depending on
                  your skin type & age. Skincare routine will also affect the
                  lasting effect of the pigment: patients who tan, use products
                  with AHA or Glycolic Acid will fade faster, as your skin will
                  resurface faster. Each individual’s color retention within the
                  skin will vary. To maintain the brows looking fresh, a touch
                  up is suggested every 12-18 months.

                <h3>How many sessions do I need?</h3>
                <p>
                  A touch up session after 4-6 weeks is necessary as everyone
                  heals differently and outcome will vary. Certain areas may not
                  pick up during the first session and will need to be refilled.
                  Pigment color may need to be adjusted, brow thickness and more
                  strokes can be added. Individuals with oily skin often require
                  a deeper shade during the touch up session as the oils tend to
                  lighten the pigment. Most importantly, your touch up session
                  is when we refine your brows to ensure it looks perfect and
                  retains the color for the whole year.

                  A typical appointment is around two hours, but the actual
                  Permanent Makeup/Microblading only happens in the last 30-45
                  minutes. The drawing is the most tedious part and the huge
                  majority of the session. It takes around 30 minutes per
                  patient just to consult on shape and size. We then draw the
                  brows on before performing the actual procedure.
